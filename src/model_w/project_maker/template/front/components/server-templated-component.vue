         *
         * 0. The content is parsed into DOM and the node containing the content
         *    is extracted so that we can work on it
         * 1. Every single component definition passed as prop should include a
         *    `selector` property which indicates what CSS selector this
         *    component should take over. All selected elements are flagged
         *    to be "componentized".
         * 2. There is a few fun considerations:
         *      - Components can appear several times with different templates
         *      - Components can include other components
         *      - We want to keep the original HTML code in the final render
         *      - The "base" HTML must be emptied of the components templates
         *        because otherwise Vue will think that the content of those
         *        component tags is the default slot and will still parse them
         *        which will of course result in errors
         *    To that effect, each defined component is actually "duplicated"
         *    every time it is found in the DOM so that it can have several
         *    templates. Once a component template has been extracted, the
         *    node containing it is emptied and replaced by a node containing
         *    the component unique name (basically the "base" name + a counter)
         *    as tag name so that later Vue can pick it up. As components can
         *    include components but also this parsing is destructive, we need
         *    to parse kids first and "eat up" the DOM from the bottom. That's
         *    done by reading the DOM in reverse.
         * 3. All parsed templates are added to a list that will be returned.
         *    The parsed templates are basically equivalent to the outerHTML.
         *    This guarantees that the template has one root node and that the
         *    output will be equivalent to the original HTML code.
         * 4. The "base" template is generated. It's the original outerHTML code
         *    with all components replaced by a unique custom tag that Vue will
         *    pick up and replace with the dynamic components that we're
         *    generating here.
